# SQL

| Project | Project Description | 
|:---|---|
|![United States](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stevenrskelton/flag-icon/master/png/16/country-4x3/us.png "United States") [Web-Scraping Political Contributions from the FEC](https://github.com/dyuthiii/PoliticalFinanContributions.git) | Here, I used an API key from the FEC's website to scrape all the financial contributions to various politicians. I had to run this over multiple days and multiple scripts as the DB ended up being too large, or some contributions were missed. I stored the scraped data in a large relational database using SQLite. The database can be found in the linked Repo. Querying Politicians should give the contributions. However, this data is limited to between January 2022 and 11 November 2024. Check out the README for more info.|

# Python

| Project | Area | Project Description | Libraries |    
|:---|---|---|---|
|ðŸ’ƒ[Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) of Taylor Swift's Albums using Lyrics](https://github.com/dyuthiii/Taylor-Swift-Albums-LDA.git) | Natural Language Processing (NLP)| I explored emerging themes in Taylor Swift's albums using NLP LDA techniques to find latent dimensions. This process involved cleaning up the lyrics using RegEx, lemmatization, Word Vectorization, visualizing word frequencies across albums, and training and testing the LDA model using GridSearchCV. Some fun and interesting insights here, check it out! | re, nltk, spaCy, gensim, matplotlib|
|ðŸ“ˆ[NLP on public Earning Calls of Medical Corporations](https://github.com/dyuthiii/CorpEarningCallNLP.git)| Natural Language Processing (NLP)| This one was our group project for our Natural Language Processing class! My part involved cleaning up web-scraped earning call transcripts and conduct Sentiment Analysis and Topic Extraction from them. We aimed to train an ML model to predict stock prices of these companies based on the sentiments extracted from the transcripts, and test if the model could accurately predict stock price changes based on the transcript sentiments and topics.| re, nltk|
